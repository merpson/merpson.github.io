            <h2>Poseidon's Trident Clan</h2>
            <p>Poseidon's Trident is a Mario Kart Wii clan that competes in division 8 of the Grand Star cup. The clan was formed in 2021 and is composed of skilled players who enjoy playing Mario Kart Wii competitively. We participate in regular online races and tournaments, and strive to improve our skills as a team.</p>
            <p>Poseidon's Trident is a new team that is primarily composed of Tier 1 Lounge players, many of whom are playing a league for the first time ever. PΨ has been doing a fair number of scrims and built up some war experience as a result, so they aren't entering blindly. The leaders of the team are Bally and anti, both of whom are also among the stronger players on the team. Bally played with Sω last season and was their best scorer, so he is definitely the name to look out for on this team. anti was signed with glw last season but didn't play much, so he's looking to change that with PΨ. Typical is one of the more prominent players of this team, while Brandon has been part of a few lower-division scrim teams and even formed a few of his own, so it's likely that he will lend his experience over. Then we have the esteemed leader of Class F, phoenix, who has the greatest amount of bagging exposure out of the entire team, as he has bagged in scrims before. </p> <br></br> <p>
                
                When it comes to trying to discuss low division teams and what their most frequent lineups are, a lot of it is like throwing darts blindfolded as many of the players are on a similar boat as each other. Most of them are Tier 1 Lounge mains around the Class E-F range. Reaper, jray, and improvise are all in the higher end of Lounge MMR on this team, and can slot in and perform well as a result. bubble, or coelho, is one of the few active Portuguese players and is also around the higher end of MMR on this team. There's also zyariewn, who is quite active in the team and might play quite a bit, and then abed and mErpson also signed with PΨ and look to get some wars in with the team. Overall, this team is quite similar to Sω from last season, not only because Bally is on the team and that there's a bunch of newer faces on the team, but also that this team does have potential to stir an upset. Sω did perform pretty well for where they were predicted to finish last time around, almost clinching a playoff spot, so PΨ looks to maybe follow that trajectory and more. Fear the wrath of King Neptune, unless you want to go bald yourself.
